# School District Analysis
## Overview
  The purpose of this analysis was to determine if reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth grades have been altered or not. The method was to replace math and reading scores from Thomas High School with NaNs and repeat the school district analysis to see how the overall analysis would be affected. Student funding and student standardized test scores for a school district were compared to demonstrate trends that can support strategic decision making from the school board.
